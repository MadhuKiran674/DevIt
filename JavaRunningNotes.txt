Exception 
-----------
Exception is nothing but unwanted unexcepted event that disturb normal flow of execution of the program

Exception Handling
----------------------
Exception handling is a mechanism which is used to handle exception by using 
Try
catch
finally
throws 
throw

try
----
try is used to write risky code 
try is also associated with either catch or finally block

riskycode
----------
the code that can be throws an exception is called risky code

catch
------
in this block we write the handling code

finally block
-----------------
finally block is used to write a cleanup code
finally block will execute irrespectively whether exception is there or not
finally block associate with try

throws
----------
it is keyword which is declare at method level
it is used to deligate the exception outside the method

throw
-------
it is keword it is used inside the method
it is bascially used create instance explicitly of the exception and handover to the jvm

Collection
-------------
collection which represent group of objects in as single entity is called collection
according to sunmicro system collection is root interface of collection framework
collection frame work
-----------------------
collection framework is defined as group of classes,objects of java.util.package

collections
---------------
collections is a utility class where the  sunmicro system has defined all the static methods to perform operations 
which can do in the following categories
List
Set
Queue
Map

Wrapper Class
--------------
wrapper class nothing but which can hold a feild where it store a value

AutoBoxing
------------
Autoboxing nothing but automatcially converting primitive datatype to object 
by the compiler is called as autoboxing

----------
List
----
This category is used to group of individual objects where duplicates are allowed
it is interface we cant create object but can hold instance of its following implementation classes
Array List
Linked List
vector 
stack
Map
-----
It is interface which is define inside th java.util.package
it is used to group of objects in the form of key and value pair where key and value should be object
key doesnt allow duplicates and value allow duplicates 
it is interface we cant create object but can hold object of its implementation classs
hashmap
linkedhashmap
identity hashmap
treemap
properties
hash table

set
----
it is interface and child interface of collection
where we can store a group of individual objects
duplicates are not allowed
it is interface we cant create object but can hold on object of its implemenatation classes
Hashset
Linked Hashset
treeset

Garabge Collector
-----------------
Garabagecollector is used to remove unsed memory automatically
whenever execute the program gabarage collector come to the picture it looks unsed thinks

Generic class
--------------
it represents type safe
it means it can accept any datatype

Super Keyword
--------------
in java,super keyword is used to refer immediate parent class of child class

this keyword
-------------
in java,the main purpose of this keyword is used to slove confusion when we have the same variable name for instance and local variables

-------------

Array list
-------------
it is implementation class list interface
duplicates are allowed
internally it follows resizable array datastructure
Linked list
-------------
internally it follows doubly linked list

variables
---------------
variables are used to store data
variables is divided into 3 type
global/instance/non static variables
static variables
local variables

Instance Variables
-----------------------
instance variables which is declare inside the class and outside the method
when we create 2 objects, then 2 times memory will be allocated in the jvm

Static variables
-------------------
static variables which is declare inside the class and outside the method by using static keyword
memory will be allocated for static static variables only once when class is loaded into jvm

static
--------
static is keyword ,which is indicates the particular method can access directly by using class name
